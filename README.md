### 👋 Hi there 
I am a deep learning/machine learning engineer and have experience with working in startups as deep learning and computer vision developer👨‍💻. Interested in making life better by letting machines learn. Fascinated about AGI (artificial general intelligence). Highly motivated for solving problems in real applications.


- 🔭 Professional experience with technology stacks with TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, OpenCV, Numpy, AWS, GCP, Docker, testing, CI/CD pipelines.
- 🔭 Fluent in Python.
- 🍔 Contributor to the open source medical imaging framework [TorchIO](https://torchio.readthedocs.io/#).
- ⚡ Worked for startups in de sports analytics and medical imaging sector.
- 💬 Already working with neural networks and deep learning since 2010. 

### Projects

#### Real time 3D player and ball tracking
For a startup in the football industry I worked on real-time autonomous player and ball tracking. To do this we developed fast deep learning based player and ball detections algorithms based on YOLO (You Only Look Once).
